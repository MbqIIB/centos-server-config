Linux or UNIX - Find and remove file syntax

The basic find command syntax is: 
#find dir-name criteria action
    dir-name : - Defines the working directory such as look into /tmp/
    criteria : Use to select files such as "*.sh"
    action : The find action (what-to-do on file) such as delete the file.

To remove multiple files such as *.jpg or *.sh with one command find, use:
#find . -name "FILE-TO-FIND" -exec rm -rf {} \;

OR

#find . -type f -name "FILE-TO-FIND" -exec rm -f {} \;

The only difference between above two syntax is that the first command remove directories as well where second command only removes files. Options:
    -name "FILE-TO-FIND" : File pattern.
    -exec rm -rf {} \; : Delete all files matched by file pattern.
    -type f : Only match files and do not include directory names.

#find . -type f -name ".Asp" -exec rm -f {} \;
