Starting services on boot in a Centos VPS is accomplished via the chkconfig command:
   1. To make the httpd start on boot in runlevel 3, the default runlevel for Centos.
      chkconfig --levels 3 httpd on
   2. To disable any service you do not want to start on boot:
    chkconfig --levels 3 httpd off
These commands add or remove symlinks from the /etc/rc.d/rc3.d directory to the script in /etc/init.d for that service.
