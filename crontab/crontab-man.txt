CRONTAB(1)                                                          CRONTAB(1)



NAME
       crontab - maintain crontab files for individual users (ISC Cron V4.1)

SYNOPSIS
       crontab [-u user] file
       crontab [-u user] [-l | -r | -e] [-i] [-s]

DESCRIPTION
       Crontab  is  the  program used to install, deinstall or list the tables
       used to drive the cron(8) daemon in ISC Cron.  Each user can have their
       own  crontab,  and though these are files in /var/spool/ , they are not
       intended to be edited directly. For SELinux in mls  mode  can  be  even
       more crontabs - for each range. For more see selinux(8).

       If the cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed therein in order
       to be allowed to use this command.  If the  cron.allow  file  does  not
       exist but the cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in
       the cron.deny file in order to use this command.  If neither  of  these
       files  exists, only the super user will be allowed to use this command.


OPTIONS
       -u     It specifies the name  of  the  user  whose  crontab  is  to  be
              tweaked.   If  this option is not given, crontab examines "your"
              crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the  command.
              Note  that su(8) can confuse crontab and that if you are running
              inside of su(8) you should always use the -u option for safety’s
              sake.   The  first form of this command is used to install a new
              crontab from some named file or standard input  if  the  pseudo-
              filename "-" is given.

       -l     The current crontab will be displayed on standard output.

       -r     The current crontab will be be removed.

       -e     This option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor
              specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables.   After
              you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed
              automatically.

       -i     This option modifies the -r option to  prompt  the  user  for  a
              ’y/Y’ response before actually removing the crontab.

       -s     It will append the current SELinux security context string as an
              MLS_LEVEL setting to the crontab file before editing /  replace-
              ment  occurs - see the documentation of MLS_LEVEL in crontab(5).

SEE ALSO
       crontab(5), cron(8)

FILES
       /etc/cron.allow
       /etc/cron.deny

STANDARDS
       The crontab command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (‘‘POSIX’’).   This
       new  command  syntax  differs  from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as
       well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

DIAGNOSTICS
       A fairly informative usage message appears if you run  it  with  a  bad
       command line.
